TODO list:

1. With the result of batch_norm, should I just implement the check_point version of training?

2. test are at the same cosmology... are they actually from different N-body sims? Or randomly selected? Wouldn't this cause any issue??

3. With the present of batch_norm, maybe should also fine-tune other hyper-parameters. In a grid search way

4. Try Huber Loss/MAE loss

5. Make another version where the NN/preprocessing are explicitly split into different summary statistics.

6. In stead of Cov from training; use maybe the Cov_data at fiducial cosmology??
